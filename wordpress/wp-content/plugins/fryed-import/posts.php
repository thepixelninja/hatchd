<p>Welcome to the online portfolio and blog of Ed Fryer.</p>
<p>So who is this \'Ed Fryer\' and why should I give a crap I hear you ask...

Well. I'm just a bloke from Sheffield (UK) who likes making things go \'swoosh\' on the tinterwebs.

I recently left my job at <a href=\'http://weare2020.com\'>2020 agency</a> (formally Digforfire) under the guise of front-end developer  to pursue a new life in Perth Australia.
</p>
So what the hell made me want to be a web designer/developer? 
<p>Well there's the short version for those of you who just want to get straight to the point... and there's my life story  for whoever's  mental enough to read it. Take your pick below.
</p><ul>
<li><a class=\'smoothScroll\' href=\'about-fryed-designs#short\'>Short version...</a></li>
<li><a class=\'smoothScroll\' href=\'about-fryed-designs#long\'>Long version...</a></li>
</ul>

The short(ish) version...

<blockquote>
There seems to be two paths to becoming a frontend web developer. The path of the computer scientist, and the path of the designer. I seem to have taken the path of the designer.
</blockquote>
<p>I first got into web design in the first year of my uni course (in visual communication). Where I did modules in flash and html/css.</p>
<p>It was around the era of Myspace and I very quickly learned I could make quite a bit of money by building custom Myspace pages for bands.</p>
<p>The more pages I did the more my knowledge grew until eventually I was hooked. After uni I got a job as a web designer at Cleverclover (a web design agency in Wakefield) Where my main role was creating designs in Photoshop to pass on to the developer to cutup.</p>
<blockquote>Then came the first recession...And weirdly it did me a favour.</blockquote>
<p>Cleverclover was only small and as cuts were made I found myself having to evolve and merge the role of developer into my role as designer.</p>
<p>Sadly Cleverclover didnâ€™t survive the recession but by that time I had already moved on to the role of front end developer at Digforfire agency (now 2020agency).</p>
<p>Due to my experience in both design and development me and another developer were brought in to bridge the gap that often appears between designers and developers.</p>
<blockquote>
My brain doesnâ€™t work like a computer and I cant set up a multi-threaded queuing service... In fact have no idea what that means. But I can design and build websites and apps from scratch and I know how to talk to clients.
</blockquote>
<p>My employers over the years have labelled me under: \'Web-designer\', \'Graphic Designer\', \'Front-end Developer\', \'Web-Developer\' and \'Multimedia-Designer\'. </p>
<p>My colleagues under: \'The guy who can somehow code even though he knows nothing of this thing they call Maths.\'</p>
<p>Client services under \'Hey you. You seem to know about Facebook. Build me an app.\' </p>
<p>and my mother under: \'Edward! Get off that computer and go outside to play with your friends.\'</p>
<p>But I prefer \'That guy who spends way too much time messing around on computers and drinks way to much black coffee\' or \'tinternet Wizard\' for short.</p>
Here is the obligatory list of stuff I can do/know about:
<ul>
<li>HTML 5 and below</li>
<li>CSS 3 (including box shadows and rounded corners!!!)</li>
<li>Javascript (jQuery,ajax,canvas) </li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>mySQL</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Wordpress</li>
<li>Drupal</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>UI/UX</li>
<li>Box2d</li>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li>Illustrator </li>
<li>Zend framework</li>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>SVN</li>
<li>Flash (not an expert but I know my way around)</li>
</ul>

My life story (the long version)...

<blockquote>
Come with me my friends and ill take you on a little journey I like to call â€œThe path to inevitable doomâ€...
</blockquote>
<p>It all started back on a frosty morning in November 1982. Where, after the meeting of two hearts little Edward Arthur Fryer was born. Back then I had a twinkle in my eye and a pocket full of dreams. If only I had known what was to become of me.</p>
<p class=\'bold\'>As a child there were four things that dominated my thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer games</li>
<li>Doodling</li>
<li>Animals</li>
<li>and food on sticks.</li>
</ul>
Computer games
<p>My obsession with computer games all started at my friends Matthews house when I was about 7.</p>
<p>We were out in the garden playing Army men, convinced our fingers could kill a man at 20 feet (of cause it only worked if we pointed with enough conviction and managed a convincing gun sound effect).</p>
<p>When my companion suddenly said. â€œHey. Lets go and play Mario.â€ </p>
<p>â€œWho is this Mario and how do I go about playing him?â€ Were my initial thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>Little did I know how this little fat red plumber with a mustache would change the way I saw the world forever.</blockquote>
<p>As soon as I got home I pestered my parents for a games console. But the answer was always 
â€œNO, you will just end up fighting with your brothers.â€ Eventually after weeks of pestering I came across an Amiga. It looked like a computer..., it smelt like a computer... but it was much much more. Here was my chance...</p>
<p>Because the good people at Commadore had cleverly decided to release a collection of substandard educational â€œcomputer gamesâ€. I could pretend the Amiga was an educational aid, imperative to my future education. Within a week I had one and the gaming began, within two me and my brothers were playing real life street fighter.</p>
Doodling
<blockquote>
â€œEver since I picked up my first crayon to doodle on my mothers wall as a kid I have loved to draw and create.â€
</blockquote>
<p>I started out at school wanting to be an artist. I think it was my love of comic books and computer game concept art that first got me interested.</p>
<blockquote>
When I was 12 I had already designed my own 'beat em up'. It was epic... Mostly.
</blockquote>
<p>I loved to doodle and used to fill a sketch book a week. I studied GCSE art and then a level art before going to chesterfield college to do my art foundation diploma. It was there I decided I wanted to be an illustrator... So naturally, I specialised in illustration.</p>
<p>Then came the time for university... I visited quite a few and looked at loads of different courses but just couldn't make my mind up so I just did what any other self respecting bloke would do! I looked over the shoulder of my mate... and copied. </p>
<blockquote>
Turns out I applied for The university of Central England in Birmingham, or UCE for short, to study on a course named Visual Communication.
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest I didn't really have a clue what Visual Communication was! And I still don't. But here is what wikipedia has to say about it:

â€œVisual communication as the name suggests is communication through visual aid and is described as the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Visual communication in part or whole relies on vision, and is primarily presented or expressed with two dimensional images, it includes: signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, colour and electronic resources. It also explores the idea that a visual message accompanying text has a greater power to inform, educate, or persuade a person or audience.â€</p>
<p>Ironically my aforementioned mate didn't get on the course and I set out to roam the streets of Birmingham on my lonesome.</p>
<p>At UCE I mainly concentrated on illustration and graphic design, but we also did modules in flash and html and it was here where I built my first website. </p>
<blockquote>
â€œIt was a joy to behold. A mangled conglomeration of marquees, animated gifs, and framesets, using tables for layout and brandishing customised cursors galore.â€
</blockquote>
<p>It was at Uni that I first discovered 3dMax and my obsession with games and drawing came together. I started doing illustration by creating my doodles in 3dmax then cell shading them. It meant I could move my 3d model in any position I wanted then hit a button and voila! I had a brand new drawing.</p>
<p>The real challenge came when trying to explain to my tutors how I did it. </p>
<blockquote>
â€œIn the end I just told them I bought the polygons from the art shop and they were made from  Plasticine... Which seemed to suffice.â€
</blockquote>
Animals
<p>Who doesn't like animals. If you don't like animals you are just plain wrong. Need I say more.</p>
Food on sticks
<p>Nearly ten times better than food not on sticks.</p>
<blockquote>
In a survey asked only last week over 50% of front-end developers prefer food on sticks to food not on sticksâ€ (2 developers asked).
</blockquote>
You are probably wondering, what the hell is this guy on about!?
<p>Here's the part where it all comes together. The drawing, the obsession with gaming and even the animals/food on sticks.</p>
<p>In my long journey to earn the title of tinternet wizard my four fabled interests have been the key to my success. My love of computer games urged me to learn to code. My love of animals and doodling powered my desire to create characters and online worlds and the whole time my love of food on sticks gave me the energy I needed to strive onwards.</p>
<p>In short... I love where life has taken me and I love the work I do. For examples of my work and what can be achieved if you have enough food on sticks checkout my <a href=\'portfolio\'>portfolio</a>, for what i'm up to personally check out my <a href=\'blog\'>blog</a>, or alternately drop me a line on my <a href=\'contact\'>contact page</a>.</p>

Usage
<p>This is a plugin for jQuery which will dynamically add a google map to any webpage with options for custom icons and google directions.</p>
<p>You can download the plugin by clicking on the link in the downloads pod.</p>
To use the google map plugin
<p>First copy the googlemap script to your server. Then include jQuery and the googlemap script in the head section of your website.</p>
<p>Then initiate the plugin by using the script below (make sure to wrap the script in a document ready or similar function).</p>

//run google map plugin
\$(\'.googleMap\').fryedGooglemap({
  postcode : \'B168UU\',
  width    : 400,
  height   : 400
});


The inbuilt options
<p>The googlemap plugin has ten inbuilt options.
</p><ul><li>width: the width of the google map (can be in % if specified as a string - ie. '100%')</li><li>height: the height of the google map</li><li>postcode: the postcode/zip code for the map to center on (overwrites lat and long values if specified)</li><li>lat: the lattitude for the map to center on (overwritten if postcode is specified - requires lng)</li><li>lng: the longitude for the map to center on (overwritten if postcode is specified - requires lat)</li><li>zoom: the zoom level of the map</li><li>icon: the custom icon path. ie. \'images/custom-icon.png\' (must be a png)</li><li>iconTitle: the text to display if the user hovers over the icon</li><li>directions: whether to show directions. if true, a form will be displayed under the map prompting for a location. and directions will be shown once 'get tirections' is clicked</li><li>debug: a helper function. if true the lat and lng of a mouse click on the map will be logged in the console. (useful for getting a lat and lng value to position the icon)</li></ul>
Notes
<p>The google directions can easily be styled from the fryed.googlemap.css file</p>

Example

$posts[] = array(
		'post_title' 	=> "jQuery Popup plugin",
		'post_content' 	=> "
<p>This is a plugin for jQuery which includes custom callable functions to open overlays, open popups, and create custom confirm dialogues.</p>
<p>You can download the plugin by clicking on the link in the downloads pod.</p>

To use the built in popup plugin

<p>First copy the popup script to your server. Then include jQuery and the popup script in the head section of your website.</p>
<p>Then initiate the plugin by using the script below (make sure to wrap the script in a document ready or similar function).</p>

//run popup plugin
\$(\'a.popup\').popup({
  popupSpeed 	: \'fast\', 
  overlaySpeed	: \'fast\',
  width		: \'500px\' 
});


The inbuilt options
<ul>
<li>popupSpeed: the speed the popup opens - can be string \'fast\' or \'slow\', or an integer in miliseconds ie. 1000</li>
<li>overlaySpeed: the speed the overlay opens  - can be string \'fast\' or \'slow\', or an integer in miliseconds ie. 1000</li>
<li>width: the width of the popup - string in \'px\'</li>
</ul>
Examples
<p>Here is a basic example with default settings â†’ <a class=\'popup\' href=\'system/data/blog_dump/test.html\' title=\'popup test title\'>popup test</a></p>
<p>The popup title is taken from the links \'title\' attribute and the content is taken from the links \'href\' attribute and loaded into the popup via ajax, so if for any reason javascript is disabled the link will still take you to the content.</p>
Anchors on different pages
<p>The plugin can also handle anchors on different pages. If an anchor is set the plugin will get the popup content from the links \'href\' attribute and filter out the part matching the anchor. See below for example.</p>
<p>Here is an example using the plugins external anchor setting â†’ <a class=\'popup\' href=\'system/data/blog_dump/test.html#popupContent\' title=\'external anchor test title\'>popup test</a></p>
<p>This will populate the popup with the html inside #popupContent from test.html</p>
<p>Most of the popup links are pointed to a file named test.html which looks a little something like below.</p>

Testing
<p>Pellentesque eu mi ligula, vel commodo enim. Mauris id nibh sed nisl eleifend ullamcorper. 
Pellentesque ornare lectus id arcu rhoncus sit amet tristique mi placerat. Etiam diam metus, 
commodo sit amet lacinia eu, iaculis ac enim. Donec congue rutrum nulla quis sollicitudin. 
Phasellus vitae eros tortor, eget scelerisque nunc.</p>
<p id=\'popupContent\'>I am the chosen text! only bring back me!</p>

 
Anchors on the same page
<p>The plugin can also deal with anchors on the same page. It gets the elaments id from the href then automatically hides the element for you. Once the link is clicked the content of the element is shown in the popup.</p>
<p>Here is an example using the plugins anchor setting â†’ <a class=\'popup\' href=\'#popupOnPage\' title=\'anchor test title\'>popup test</a></p>

	<p>Hi there! im some content being brought back from this page!</p>	


To use the built in confirm plugin

<p>The in-built confirm plugin is easily styled from the css and has six inbuilt options. It was build to provide a much nicer looking version of the default javascript confirm dialogue.</p>

//run confirm plugin
\$(\'a.confirm\').confirm({
  question 	: \'Are you sure?\',
  buttonPos	: \'yes\',
  buttonNeg	: \'no\',
  callback	: onAnswer,
  popupSpeed 	: \'fast\',
  overlaySpeed	: \'fast\',
  width		: \'200px\'
});

//example usage of callback function
function onAnswer(answer){
  if(answer)
    alert(\'confirm\');
  else
    alert(\'deny\');	
}


The inbuilt options
<ul>
	<li>question: the question the popup asks - can be any string you want ie: \'are you sure?\'</li>
	<li>buttonPos: the text of the positive button - can be any string you want ie: \'yes\'</li>
	<li>buttonNeg: the text of the negative button - can be any string you want ie: \'no\'</li>
	<li>callback: the function to perform on click of yes or no button - example below</li>
	<li>popupSpeed: the speed the popup opens - can be string \'fast\' or \'slow\', or an integer in miliseconds ie. 1000</li>
	<li>popupSpeed: the speed the overlay opens  - can be string \'fast\' or \'slow\', or an integer in miliseconds ie. 1000</li>
	<li>width: the width of the popup - string in \'px\'</li>
</ul>
Example
<p>Here is an example â†’ <a class=\'confirm\' href=\'#\' title=\'confirm\'>confirm test</a></p>
<p>Same as with the popup plugin the confirm title is taken from the links \'title\' attribute. With the confirm plugin the content is created by the javascript so there is no need for a link in the \'href\' attribute.</p>

Use of custom functions

<p>You can also use the functions included to open a popup or overlay with ease anywhere else in your javascript in exactly the same way you would use other jQuery functions.</p>

//open custom overlay
openOverlay(\'slow\');

//open custom overlay with callback
openOverlay(\'slow\',function(){
  alert(\'overlay open\');
});

//open custom popup
openPopup(\'slow\',\'title here\',\'test.html\',\'500px\');

//open custom popup with callback
openPopup(\'slow\',\'title here\',\'test.html\',\'500px\',function(){
  alert(\'popup opened\');
});


Notes
<p>If other items on the page are appearing above the overlay or popup, then please make sure they have a lower z-index than the overlay/popup.
Also if you want the overlay to appear over flash objects, make sure you set the param \'wmode\' to transparent.</p>

Usage

	<p>Then initiate the plugin by using the script below (make sure to wrap the script in a document ready or similar function).</p>
	The inbuilt options
	<p>The fryed.validate script has seven inbuilt options.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>default_error_text: the error text used for an empty required field if no html5 valdation exists.</li>
		<li>email_error_text: as above but for email fields ie \'input type='email'\'</li>
		<li>number_error_text: as above but for number fields ie \'input type='number'\'</li>
		<li>zipcode_error_text: as above but for fields with a class of 'zipCode' ie \'input class='zipCode'\'</li>
		<li>url_error_text: as above but for url fields ie \'input type='url'\'</li>
		<li>callback: a function to call instead of submitting the form. (useful for sending form data via ajax)</li>
		<li>overwriteDefault: whether or not to use the scripts style of validation or fallback to browser specific validation. (either way those browsers capable of html 5 validation will use html5 validation . this purely effects the look of the inbuilt browser validation for cross browser consistancy)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you want to validate an input/select/textarea then simply add the html5 required='required' attribute. Also the script will allow non html5 browsers to make use of the placeholder='placeholder here' attribute.</p>


A basic example


	<p>A simple example which uses the overwrite default option to make the form perform the same across all browsers.</p>
	<p>It overwrites the browsers default html5 styles but still uses the html5 functionality.</p>


//run validate plugin
\$(\'form.validate\').fryedValidate({
  overwriteDefault : true
});


An example with an ajax callback


	<p>This example specifies the function 'ajaxMe' as a callback thus preventing the default submit action. The data can then be sent via ajax or some other functionality can be implemented.</p>


//run validate plugin
\$(\'form.validate\').fryedValidate({
  overwriteDefault : true,
  callback	: ajaxMe
});

<p>How many times have you seen those apps that won't let you get to the juicy content until you like the page? Annoying! But clients love it.</p>
<p>Here is how you achieve it. (Remember this will only work on apps and custom pages within facebook and dosn't  require the sdk or the user to connect to your app.)</p>

How it works

<p>As you will notice the php class above gets all the info it needs from the \'signed_request\' variable.</p>
<p>This \'signed request\' is sent to every facebook app and page on facebook and includes all kinds of goodies including whether the current logged in facebook user has liked your page.</p>
<p>Essentially it is a base64 encoded object, so with a bit of php wizardry and the base64_decode function we now have access to some facebook goodies.</p>
<p>It can also be used to pass variables into your app but ill go into that in another post.</p>

<p>Have you ever written a facebook app or custom page and needed to pass a variable into the app via a query string?</p>
<p>To be honest its a nightmare, and a lot harder than it should be (as will all things facebook related) but the good news is... it is possible.</p>
<p>I first needed to do this on an app I wrote which was essentially a glorified gallery for an event where people could find pictures of themselves taken by professional photographers. Once the user had found their photo the had the option to share the photo.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty simple? but its harder than you first think.</p>
<p>At first I thought... easy, Ill just share a link with a query string containing the id of the photo. Then when people arrive at the app from the shared link I could automatically show the shared image and not the home page of the app.</p>
<p>But as you are cleverer than me you probably just thought.</p>
<blockquote>
DURR! What is this guy on about? Everyone knows the app is embedded in an iframe by facebook so clearly the query string will be inaccessible
</blockquote>
<p>And you would be right.</p>
<p>So I started researching and found the key was in the signed request sent to the app by facebook. If you add a query with a key of \'app_data\' to the end of the app url then this data, and only this data will get passed into the app.</p>
<p>Below is the class you will need (the same one that works out if the page is liked) and an example of how to pass data to your app.</p>

The facebook class
//----------FACEBOOK CLASS----------//

class facebook {
	
  var \$fbLiked;
  var \$isFb;
  var \$fbData;
 
  //init
  function facebook(){
	
    \$this-&gt;fbLiked = false;
    \$this-&gt;isFb = false;
    \$this-&gt;fbData = false;
	
    if(isset(\$_REQUEST[\'signed_request\'])){
      \$encoded_sig = null;
      \$payload = null;
      list(\$encoded_sig,\$payload) = explode(\'.\',\$_REQUEST[\'signed_request\'],2);
      \$sig = base64_decode(strtr(\$encoded_sig,\'-_\',\'+/\'));
      \$data = json_decode(base64_decode(strtr(\$payload,\'-_\',\'+/\'),true));
      if(\$data-&gt;page-&gt;liked){
        \$this-&gt;fbLiked = true;
      }
      if(isset(\$data-&gt;app_data)){
        \$this-&gt;fbData = \$data-&gt;app_data;
      }
      \$this-&gt;isFb = true;	
    }
	
  }

  //function to return liked status
  function liked(){
    return \$this-&gt;fbLiked;
  }

  //function to return if on facebook
  function isFacebook(){
    return \$this-&gt;isFb;
  }

  //function to return query passed in url
  function getData(){
    return \$this-&gt;fbData;	
  }
	
}

Usage for single variable

<p>Below is an example of how to pass a single variable into an app. In this example the result would be \'The data passed to the app = foo\'</p>
<p>Passing multiple variables is a bit trickier and I will explain how to do it further down the page.</p>

The url with the app_data query

http://facebook.com/YOUR_PAGE/app_XXXXXXXXXX?app_data=foo

The PHP
\$FB = new facebook();
echo \'The data passed to the app = \'.\$FB-&gt;getData();

Usage for multiple variables

<p>As I said, multiple variables are a bit trickier. As we are only allowed to pass the one parameter \'app_data\' to the app we will need to be crafty.</p>
<p>If we pass a json object as the value of \'app_data\' we can send as many variables as we want to the app as long as we remember to properly encode and decode the data. (luckily the class above does most of the work for you so make sure to take a look if you want to know how it works)</p>

The url with the app_data query as a json object

http://facebook.com/YOUR_PAGE/app_XXXXXXXXXX?app_data={foo:\'bar\',speak:\'Hello world\'}

The PHP
//init the facebook class
\$FB = new facebook();

//get the app data object
\$appData = \$FB-&gt;getData();

//param 1
echo \'foo = \'.\$appData-&gt;foo;

//param 2
echo \'speak = \'.\$appData-&gt;speak;

Notes

<p>Remember to always url encode your json object before sharing the url  (see example below). Otherwise the whole thing will fall apart.</p>

//the json object string
\$json = \'{foo:'bar',speak:'Hello world'}\';
//url encode
\$json = urlencode(\$json);
//the link
\$link = \'http://facebook.com/YOUR_PAGE/app_XXXXXXXXXX?app_data=\'.\$json;

<p>I spent hours the other day searching and searching the Facebook SDK documentation for the ability to detect the dreaded https mode in Facebook custom tabs.</p>

<p>Anyone who has tried to find anything useful or up to date in the Facebook docs will know how hard it can be to find anything of use on the Facebook developer pages.</p>

<p>After about half a day of searching and trying multiple methods from the PHP SDK then the JS SDK I decided Facebook documentation was crap and I was going to have to find an alternate method.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to search the php \'signed_request\' variable that gets sent by Facebook to all page tabs. I knew I could retrieve information such as whether my page was liked, and the age and id of the user viewing the page from this encoded variable (<a href=\'http://www.fryed.co.uk/blog/how-to-detect-if-someone-likes-your-facebook-page\' title=\'How to detect if someone likes your facebook page\'>Read about the signed request variable here</a>) So it seemed logical to me that Facebook would also include whether the tab was in secure mode hereâ€¦</p>

<p>Alas I was wrong and I was still no closer to my goal.</p>

<p>Then I had an Idea! How could I have been so stupid! I had already tried to grab the protocol from the Facebook iframe with javascriptâ€¦</p>



var protocol = window.parent.location.protocol;
console.log(protocol);




<p>(I know this is stupid because of cross domain policy and probably would never work, but come onâ€¦ its Facebook. We all know Facebook behaves in the weirdest ways.).</p> 

<p>Why didn't I just use the php equivalent and grab the protocol from the \$_SERVER varâ€¦ (<a href=\'http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php\' title=\'PHP manual on server vars\'>See here for info on the \$_SERVER var here</a>)</p>



\$protocol = \$_SERVER[\'SERVER_PROTOCOL\'];
die(\$protocol);




<p>I headed over to my Facebook page tab in http mode expecting to see the words \'HTTP/0.1\'... Which I did. At this point I was convinced I had cracked it. As my mouse hovered over the address bar and I edited the url to read https I was certain that once i refreshed the page the words \'HTTPS/0.1\' would be there waiting for meâ€¦ I would be filled with joy and treat my self to a victory sausage roll. Oh how much fun I would haveâ€¦</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>Again i was faced with the dreaded \'HTTP/0.1\' not the \'HTTPS/0.1\' that I had so hoped for.</p>

<p>This seemed strange to me as surely it should have worked... but as we all know all is not as it seems on facebook</p>

<p>It was now the end of the day and out of pure desperation I thought I would check the contents of the \$_SERVER var in php. To do this I simply didâ€¦</p>



echo \'\';
print_r(\$_SERVER);
die(\'\');




<p>To my surprise there was a load of information in there that isn't normally found. Try it yourself on your own page tab and you may be amazed at what you will find.</p>

<p>One value in particular stood out to me. The \'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO\' var. I noticed that if the page was being served in http, the value of this var was \'http\' and low and behold if the page was being served in https the value was \'https\'. This was behaving exactly as I thought the \'SERVER_PROTOCOL\' var should have.</p>

<p>HOORAR!, My dilemma was solved and I could get on with my dayâ€¦ Which was now over. Time to go home and have a sausage roll methinks.</p>

<p>In summary if you want to know whether you page tab is being served in http or https you can use the following phpâ€¦</p>



//check for facebook custom protocol val
if(isset(\$_SERVER[\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO\'])){
  \$protocol = stringtolower(\$_SERVER[\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO\']);
//if not there use the default protocol var
}else{
  \$protocol = stringtolower(\$_SERVER[\'SERVER_PROTOCOL\']);
}
//check if the var contains the string \'https\'
\$https = false;
if(strstr(\$protocol,\'https\') !== false)){
  \$https = true;
