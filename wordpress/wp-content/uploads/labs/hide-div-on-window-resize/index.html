	<p>If you cant see a blue box below then your window is less than 1024px wide. Try resizing your browser window to see the function in action.</p>
		
	<div id="floatDiv">I fade out if the window width is less than 1024px</div>
	
	<p>This is obviously a very simple example and with the introduction of media queries it is almost obsolete.</p>
	<p>It was written in answer to a stack overflow question posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5277872/hide-a-div-if-screen-is-narrower-than-1024px/5278004#5278004" target="_top">here</a>
	where a guy was asking how to make a single media query he had work in old versions of ie.</p>
	<p>Normally I would recommend using <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond" target="_top">respond.js</a> but for a single media query that method seems a bit bloated.</p>
